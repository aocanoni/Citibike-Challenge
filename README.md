# Citibike-Challenge

*This repository exists due to being unable to upload my final citibike challenge workbook to the tableau server. 

This repository contains the zip files I downloaded and used for the challenge, as well as screenshots of the final cleaned three datasets (as well as relationships and unions), and screenshots of the names of worksheets and dashboards that I used in my final story. 

This is the link to the final story:
