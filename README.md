# Citibike-Challenge

*This repository exists due to being unable to upload my final citibike challenge workbook to the tableau server. 

- This repository contains the zip files I downloaded and used for the challenge- I only used the June CSVs from each year provided. 

- There are also screenshots of the final cleaned three datasets (as well as relationships and unions), and screenshots of examples of worksheets and dashboards that I used in my final story. 

This is the link to the final story:

- You should be able to view all the dashboards and the worksheets associated with them through the story by interacting with the buttons.
